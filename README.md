### Why don't my Generation results compare to Greedy?
The most obvious reason is that the performance of genetic algorithms is highly dependent on parameter settings, such as population size, mutation rate, crossover rate, and so on. If these parameters are not set appropriately, it may result in an algorithm that is much less effective than the greedy algorithm.

Example:
If the mutation rate is too low, the algorithm may lack the ability to explore new solutions.
If the population is too small, the algorithm may lack diversity and thus fall into a local optimum.

But I modified the data and it only changed from 15000 to 14000.
